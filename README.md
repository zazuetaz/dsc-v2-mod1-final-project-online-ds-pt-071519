# Mod 1 Final Project - Zazueta, Zach

### Aims
The goal of this project was to utilize the material on Linear Regression Covered in the first module of the Data Science curriculum. We were provided with a data set of King County WA home specs and were trying to determine which of the attributes of the homes had the most impact on sale prices. These were homes that sold between May '14 and May '15.

### Important Contents of the Repository
The repository contains the following:
* A folder named 'Provided Materials'. Those are the materials provided for the project, including the original data set.
* student-FinalSubmission.ipbny - the Jupyter Notebook I used to write my code for the project.
* drivers.png - a graphic used for the presentation
* presentation.pdf - a PDF of the non-technical presentation
* Final Presentation.mp4 - the video walk through of the non-technical presentation.

### Additional Notes
The contents of the JN will provide the reader with full context of my approach to the project.
